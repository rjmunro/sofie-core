# Quick install

## Installing for testing \(or production\)

### **Prerequisites**

* **Linux**: Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04).
* **Windows**: Install [Docker for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).

### Installation

This docker-compose file automates the basic setup of the [Sofie-Core application](../../for-developers/libraries.md#main-application), the backend database and different Gateway options.

```yaml
# This is NOT recommended to be used for a production deployment.
# It aims to quickly get an evaluation version of Sofie running and serve as a basis for how to set up a production deployment.

Create a `Sofie` folder, copy the above content, and save it as `docker-compose.yaml` within the `Sofie` folder.

Visit [Rundowns & Newsroom Systems](installing-a-gateway/rundown-or-newsroom-system-connection/intro.md) to see which _Ingest Gateway_ can be used in your specific production environment. If you don't have an NRCS that you would like to integrate with, you can use the [Rundown Editor](rundown-editor) as a simple Rundown creation utility. Navigate to the _ingest-gateway_ section of `docker-compose.yaml` and select which type of _ingest-gateway_ you'd like installed by uncommenting it. Save your changes.

Open a terminal, execute `cd Sofie` and `sudo docker-compose up` \(or just `docker-compose up` on Windows\). This will download MongoDB and Sofie components' container images and start them up. The installation will be done when your terminal window will be filled with messages coming from `playout-gateway_1` and `core_1`.

Once the installation is done, Sofie should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Next, you need to make sure that the Playout Gateway and Ingest Gateway are connected to the default Studio that has been automatically created. Open the Sofie User Interface with [Configuration Access level](../features/access-levels#browser-based) by opening [http://localhost:3000/?admin=1](http://localhost:3000/?admin=1) in your Web Browser and navigate to _Settings_&nbsp;🡒 _Studios_&nbsp;🡒 _Default Studio_&nbsp;🡒 _Peripheral Devices_. In the _Parent Devices_ section, create a new Device using the **+** button, rename the device to _Playout Gateway_ and select _Playout gateway_ from the _Peripheral Device_ drop down menu. Repeat this process for your _Ingest Gateway_ or _Sofie Rundown Editor_.

:::note
Starting with Sofie version 1.52.0, `sofietv` container images will run as UID 1000.

### Tips for running in production

There are some things not covered in this guide needed to run _Sofie_ in a production environment:

- Logging: Collect, store and track error messages. [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) and [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) is one way to do it.
- NGINX: It is customary to put a load-balancer in front of _Sofie&nbsp;Core_.
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring.

## Installing for Development

Installation instructions for installing Sofie-Core or the various gateways are available in the README file in their respective github repos.

Common prerequisites are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
Links to the repos are listed at [Applications & Libraries](../../for-developers/libraries.md).
